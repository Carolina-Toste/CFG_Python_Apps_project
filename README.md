# Code First Girls: Introduction to Apps and Python Course
I undertook this course run by Code First Girls during Winter 2023. This course is an 8 week introductory course and we used Pycharm throughout the course and covered the following topics:

data types and variables
loops
functions
if statements
comparison and logical operators
lists and dictionaries
APIs

## Final Project
This repository contains my final project which was a requirement of the course. It's a small program to search for recipes from the edamam API based on an ingredient and known allergens. The [Search_recipe.py](https://github.com/Carolina-Toste/CFG_Python_and_Apps_final_project/blob/main/Search_recipe.py) script contains the code used in this project.
